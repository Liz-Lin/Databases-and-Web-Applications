Title: 
since it's hard for user to memorize the entire movie's name,
so we decide to let user only need to enter part of movie name.
LIKE '%partial_name%'

Director
since it's hard for user to memorize the entire director's name,
so we decide to let user only need to enter part of their name.
LIKE '%partial_name%'

Year:
need to be exactly matching, or it will give way too many results

Actor:
since it's hard for user to memorize the entire actor's name,
so we decide to let user only need to enter part of their name.
In addition, if user enter more than one name (separate by space)
it will help user to match each name individually, 
then combine all the results together.
LIKE '%partial_name_1' OR '%partial_name_2%' OR '%partial_name_3%'.....


Note:
The attribute above are AND combine together. If user enter more information
about one movie, it means either user knows more about that movie, or 
want to narrow the result down. So we decide to ADD all the attribute together,
but inside of each one we will use LIKE to aid user in searching.
